<h1>Shopping Cart:</h1> This is shopping cart project built with react.
<h1>Description:</h1> Shopping cart, add to cart from available items, return the items, checkout your items and eliminate the quantities from the available stock. The restocking feature will not work as the API used for the feature is not deployed to server.
<h1>Future Improvements:</h1> I will be looking to deploy the api used for the restocking feature so the cart will be fully functional.
<h1>Usage:</h1> Click on this <a href="https://amato1891.github.io/cart/"><strong>LINK</strong></a> to try it out!
